Device is defined as an abstract class because it represents a general concept that shouldn't be instantiated on its own. It enforces a contract for all subclasses by declaring getStatus() as abstract, which means every device must provide its own implementation for reporting statuses. The Networked and batteryPowered interfaces can be opted into by a class, which is a flexible way to add distinct functionalities. This however is not an example of multiple inheritance because Java cannot support multiple inheritance of classes.
