Me: Okay, Nice! Now using the code I provided you, can you give me some ideas on how I can make it more object-oriented? Do not modify the code in any way. I just want you to brainstorm methods.

Gemini: Of course! You can make the code more object-oriented by breaking down the static, procedural logic into distinct classes that each represent a core part of the ETL process. The current code works, but it runs as a single, static procedure inside the main method. A more object-oriented approach involves creating objects whose job is to encapsulate behavior. We can create separate classes for the "Extract," "Transform," and "Load" steps.

Me: Why didn’t you choose to use the other OO methodologies within your solution?


Gemini: Your ETL components (Extractor, Transformer, Loader) are distinct specialists; they don't share a common "base" identity. There was no need for one to inherit from another. Also, since you only had one type of data source (CSV) and one set of transformation rules, there was no need to create a system that could handle multiple forms of extractors or transformers.

Me: Will it still be considered object-oriented if it's all within one file or does it have to be split into multiple? (because it had suggested to split the code into multiple files).

Gemini: Excellent question! Yes, your code is absolutely still considered object-oriented, even when it's all in one file. The key takeaway is that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a design philosophy, not a rule about file structure…
